# Modeling the Runyarwanda language

Known as Kinyarwanda, this bantu language is one of the richest language linguistically speaking. 
However; like most African languages, Runyarwanda has gone through alot of changes and has adopted or borrowed words from other languages. 
This is not bad at all, since it caraterizes a used language meaning its very much alive.
The problem, however; being that when the foreign colonizers of the 19th Century, come to Rwanda; they introduced another form of recording known as writting.
The Banyarwanda had their ways of recording their thoughts through poems, songs oral citations and used to pass them through generation in various artistic ways.
The writing method was a handy tool, but the way Runyarwanda was written differs by far of how the Banyarwanda spoke. 
This weakness has a serious impact since it falls short on recording the inginuity and the thought processes of Banyarwanda.
This project is a way of addressing this issue but also putting Runyarwanda in a structured way that would eventually turn into a proper language model.
