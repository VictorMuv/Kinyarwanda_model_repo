# Kinyarwanda Digitization

Kinyarwanda digitization evokes a multiple of sub activities; Language to language translation, Text classifications, speech to text, text to speech, speech recognition, etc.
The project that is currently ongoing under the sponsorship of GIZ limits itself on language to language translation or as mentioned machine translation. In close collaboration with Myculture and other relevant stakeholders; this machine translation project will use a specific but limited language model and Data to train this model is being collected. This was considered a pilot project for Kinyarwanda digitization.
However; Kinyarwanda Digitization should enable other language related applications such as text categorization that have even much more interesting useful applications like; News grouping, sentiment analysis, hate speech recognition; englobed in Natural Language Processing or NLP.
To give context to what NLP would be doing and what activities should take place; let’s begin by introducing some models and what it would take to prepare text or language datasets.

* <h3> Character encoding </h3>

This technique converts individual characters or letters into numbers or technically known as character tokenization. 
This technique, however has serious limitations because there are words (unigrams); that have the same characters in different order which a machine can’t recognize the difference. 

* <h3> Word Based encoding </h3>

This techique; instead of tokenizing each single letter; it tokenizes full words. However better is compared to character encoding it still has shortcomings as it lacks semantic recognition.

* <h3> Embedding </h3>

This is the best technique of all; as it encodes sematics into vestors. This allows grouping related words by pointing their vestors in the same direction.

## The Concept

After analysis of the written literature of the Kinyarwanda language; it was found that having Kinyarwanda model with the current written techniques it would be costly in terms of grouping related words. The written Kinyarwanda language obstruct related words and mixes up words with their articles and adjectives. This lack of separation causes confusion and costs a lot of unnecessary input data. 

The Approach would to separate words and write the Kinyarwanda language in a much more structured manner to ease the task and allow machine learn the immense richness of the Kinyarwanda linguistic ingenuity. By re-writing Kinyarwanda in a proper or structured manner; modeling it becomes very much easier and less costly.
The Approach.

The Ministry of ICT and Innovation endorses this project as it falls perfectly in its mandate of inducing innovations and research. 
The Ministry would like to put together a team that would explore this research project. It is through this though process that a small group composed with Machine learning experts, Mathematicians and linguists will be working on the Kinyarwanda Modeling. 

### Activities

1. 	Budget for the project with a prospect partner
1. 	Defining the scope of work and terms of references
1. 	Hire ML, AI, mathematician and linguistics professionals with the right skill set.
1. 	Timeline; 6 months. 



### Sustainability Model

Kinyarwanda Digitization will result into a language model that could be potentially be used by other bantu languages in the region. 
Intellectual property rights will be something to consider. Other researchers or innovators who would like to use it for applications in their languages would be subjected to the IP. The team that will be working on this project will also be aware of the implications of IP rights and would come up with a comprehensive approach that factors in the IP.
